emmet-core
==========

This repository contains packed version of [emmet](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet) created from
https://raw.github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime/master/emmet/emmet-app.js  and
https://raw.github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime/master/emmet/snippets.json.

This was created to be used in [Ace demo page](http://ace.c9.io/demo/emmet.html), but it doesn't have
anything special for Ace, and you can use any other version of emmet instead.
