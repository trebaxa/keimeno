            Keimeno was invented by Harald Petrich and is developed since 2005. Due the years it grows up to successful CM Framework for developing customers projects. </p>
            <p>First customers belong to the B2B business. Their decision was to get rid of the high support costs of other CM Software products, lower development costs and decided to
            be more secure with Keimeno. The main idea of Keimeno was to have a fast and easy handling environment for web projects.</p>
            <p>With Keimeno you have a fast and secure CM software, which you can easily learn and is native in use for customer.
            Keimeno is based on all commend standards like PHP, mySQL, Jquery, Bootstrap and Smarty. There is no need to study a bench of books or additional script language
            to handle it. Keimeno is also easily to install on any kind of apache server and for agencies and customers really supportable.

            In the year 2015 we opened a software community, so other developers can send us their apps, so we can do a review and publish them. Each app will be checked form our
            team before it get his approval. So we will have also in future a high quality product.

            <p>Marc Weber redesigned the backend of Keimeno.</p>
            <p>He realised many client websites with the Keimeno CMS and helped to improve the functionality of the system.</p>
            <p>He's a constant pain in the neck for Harald Petrich with his daily requests of new functions and improvements to keep the CMS
              up-to-date to be ready for modern technologies and fullfill every customer request.</p>
